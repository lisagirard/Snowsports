Evaluating Snowsports Participation Decision Factors 


Objective: What conditions contribute to the decision to particpate in snowsports (ski/snowboard) at a Norwegian ski resort? 

Conclusions:
<ul><li>Analyzed what conditions contribute to the decision to participate in snowsports at a Norwegian ski resort</li>
<li>Conducted unsupervised machine learning model comparison between 4 algorithms and 3 dimensionality reduction techniques</li>
<li>Discovered 6 distinct clusters of "types of skiers" that were identified by family status, distance from resort, weather preference, age, gender, and more</li>
<li>Advised Marketing, Operations, and C-Level leaders how to use clusters to implement marketing and management changes</li></ul>
